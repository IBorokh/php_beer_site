# php_beer_site
My first experience in web-development

The creation of this site was the result of laboratory work on web programming. It's not perfect, but it has things like:
  - holistic navigation
  - a page containing a google map
  - a page containing a video
  - a simple application that creates a pie chart (PHP)
  - an application that displays one of 3 memes through a form
  - form for interacting with the database
